# ITERATIONS — TP MXFP4 MegaMoE

Metric: `RUNTIME` = TP forward latency (per-rank compute + all-reduce), max across ranks, lower is better.
Correctness: cosine vs torch mxfp4-dequant golden (gate >= 0.99 in loop).

Config: M=8, E=128, topk=8, tp=8, H=6144, I=2048 (Is=256). E reduced 384->128 for GPU-contention memory headroom (etgong on GPUs 5-7); touched experts <= M*topk = 64.

## Summary
| iter | direction | RUNTIME (ms) | cosine | notes |
|------|-----------|--------------|--------|-------|
| baseline | vectorized-torch partial FFN (rank0 compute) | 20.52 | 0.99999 | dequant ALL 128 experts fp32 + fp32 matmul |
| 1 | dequant touched-only + bf16 tensor-core matmul | 9.54 | 0.99999 | 2.15x; only <=64 touched experts, bf16 GEMM |
| 2 | CUDA MXFP4->bf16 dequant kernel (load_inline) | 2.04 | 0.99999 | 4.7x; dequant was 94% (8.9ms), now fused 1-pass GPU |
| 3 | vectorized dequant (uint32 read / uint4 write, 8-nibble chunk/thread) | 1.52 | 0.99999 | 1.34x; dequant 1.42->~0.9ms (was uncoalesced 1B/thread) |
| 4 | FULLY FUSED kernel: dequant+FC1+SwiGLU+FC2 in-register, 1 block/pair | 1.12 | 1.00000 | 1.36x; no bf16 materialization; reads only packed weights; fp32 accum -> cosine 1.0. THE target kernel shape. |
| 5 | warp-per-output reduction (coalesced K) + 512 threads | 1.09 | 1.00000 | 1.02x only -> occupancy floor: just 64 blocks (M*topk pairs) on 78 SMs. Next axis = more blocks (split output tiles), not warp/thread tuning. |

## FINAL verdict (best = iter-5, HEAD)
Real config E=384 (kernel cost independent of E: only <=M*topk touched experts computed):
- M=8:  RUNTIME 1.09 ms  cosine 1.00000  (53.2x vs torch mxfp4-dequant ref 58ms)  FULL_FORWARD 2.86ms
- M=16: RUNTIME 2.13 ms  cosine 1.00000  (27.8x)
- M=32: RUNTIME 4.25 ms  cosine 1.00000  (14.4x)
RUNTIME ~linear in M (1 block per token-expert pair). Overall baseline->iter5: 20.5->1.09ms = 18.8x on the compute; correctness perfect (fp32 accum).
Next axis (untried): 2-kernel split (FC1-once + FC2 tiled) to raise block count above the 64-block floor for small M; payoff capped by GPU-0 contention (etgong), so measurement is noisy. Also: fold all-reduce into symm-buffer NVLink (currently dist.all_reduce) per the original spec.

## Container single-GPU compute bench (in mlb_refactor_bench_20260809; the per-rank kernel we optimize)
Prior single-fused kernel (iter5) was FLAT ~1.07ms for M=1..8 (raw kernel 1.06ms, python wrapper 0.03ms) = latency/occupancy starved (M=1 -> only 8 blocks on 78 SMs).
| iter | M=1 | M=8 | notes |
|------|-----|-----|-------|
| iter5 (1 block/pair) | 1.07 ms | 1.09 ms | flat = occupancy floor |
| 6 (2-kernel tiled nA=8/nB=16) | 0.154 ms | 0.95 ms | 7x at M=1; grid P*nA(FC1)+P*nB(FC2); cosine 1.0 |
| 7 (ako4x-swept nA=16/nB=48) | 0.140 ms | 0.93 ms | 8-GPU parallel (nA,nB,threads) sweep in container; M2=0.27 M4=0.48; runtime now linear in M (occupancy fixed), scalar-compute-bound |

ako4x sweep (M=1, parallel across free GPUs 0-4 in container, no recompile): (nA=16,nB=48)=0.139 (nA=32,nB=96)=0.140 (nA=16,nB=96)=0.141 ... (nA=8,nB=16)=0.150. Cluster ~0.14ms floor for M=1 with scalar 2-kernel. Next lever = tensor cores (MXFP4->fp8 WGMMA), a larger rewrite.

## GOAL 2: tp=4, M=8..128, SOL>=70% (in megamoe container: nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:25.02-py3, torch2.7/cu12.8, ncu OK)
tp=4 => Is=512 (kernel now dispatches Is in {256,512}). Scalar 2-kernel baseline (nA=16,nB=48), cosine 1.0:
  M=8 1.83ms | M=16 3.54 | M=32 6.97 | M=64 13.9 | M=128 27.66  (linear in M, ~27us/pair)
ncu SpeedOfLight (tp4 M32): fc1 Compute-SM 98.6% / Mem 16.5% / DRAM 3.4% (4.99ms); fc2 Compute-SM 97.7% / Mem 20% (2.53ms).
=> SCALAR-PIPE SATURATED (98%) but memory idle (16%). Arithmetic intensity ~11 FLOP/byte << H20 ridge ~666 => problem is MEMORY-BOUND; scalar dequant+FMA is the wall. To hit 70% MEMORY SOL must move compute to TENSOR CORES (MXFP4->fp8 WGMMA) so kernel becomes memory-bound (weight reads). Memory floor ~0.3-0.6ms for M=32 (touched experts x 4.5MB / 3TB/s) => ~15-25x headroom. Next: fp8 WGMMA FC1/FC2 with in-register MXFP4->fp8 dequant (fold E8M0), per-expert grouping (BLOCK_M pad; per-expert M tiny but memory-bound so tensor-core m-underutil is hidden).

## iter 9: branchless ARITHMETIC dequant (no __constant__ LUT) — the constant LUT kFP4V[nib&7] had DIVERGENT indices -> constant-cache serialized up to 8-way. Replaced with bit-construct float. cosine 1.0.
tp=4 (arith): M8 0.764 | M16 1.443 | M32 2.810 | M64 5.561 | M128 11.04 ms  (~2.4x vs iter8 scalar-LUT). Materialize+matmul variant was 4x SLOWER (30ms M32) -> fused is right.

## iter 9 SOL after arith: ncu tp4 M32 fc1 Compute-SM 88.2%% / Mem 42%% (was 98.6/16.5). Compute SOL >70%. float-xs-in-smem only +2%% (not adopted). Config sweep tp4 M32: nA16/nB48 optimal (2.81ms). Next lever for memory-SOL/abs-speed = group-by-expert (M128 ~2.7 tok/expert -> ~2.7x less redundant dequant).

## iter 10: shared-mem LUT dequant (replace ~6 arith ops with 1 LDS+sign; smem broadcast avoids constant-cache serialize). tp4: M8 0.50 | M16 0.94 | M32 1.82 | M64 3.59 | M128 7.12 ms (~1.5x vs arith). USER CORRECT: kernel is ALU-bound (ncu ALU pipe 89.6%%, DRAM only 431GB/s=~13%% peak) not mem-bound. SOL vs THEORETICAL memory time: tp4 M32 theoretical ~0.36ms (1.2GB/3.3TBs per-pair) -> current 1.82ms = SOL ~20%%. Target 70%% = ~0.5ms. Levers: cheaper dequant (ALU), vectorize weight loads (uint4), group-by-expert (kill per-pair redundant reads).

## iter 10 reprofile + roofline honesty: smem-LUT reprofile (tp4 M32): SpeedOfLight Memory 96.5%% but that is SHARED-mem LDS (the LUT); DRAM only 14%% (431 GB/s). Still pipe-bound not DRAM-bound. Theoretical mem ~0.28-0.36ms vs 1.82ms => SOL ~15-20%%. FUNDAMENTAL: MXFP4 dequant ~3 op/nibble min, reads 0.5 byte/nibble => ~6 op/byte ~ H20 ridge (~5) => pure 70%% memory-SOL is HARD for W4A16 dequant-GEMV (theoretical ceiling ~50-60%% SOL). uint4+scale-hoist tried -> REGRESSED (4.8ms, register spill from 32-nibble unroll+arrays), discarded. Next lever: group-by-expert (M128 ~2.7x, approach unique-read floor).

## fold experiment (DEAD END for scalar): fp8-fold dequant (SIMD ~0.5op/nibble, validated 1518GB/s materializing fp8) -> but scalar GEMV needs FLOAT, so fp8->float cvt per element costs more than saved: 2.47ms (SLOWER than smem-LUT 1.82) + had a correctness bug. CONCLUSION: fp8-fold ONLY pays with fp8 WGMMA (consumes fp8 directly, no cvt). On Hopper scalar path, bf16 smem-LUT (1.82ms) is near-optimal; it is compute/LSU-bound, ~20%% mem-SOL. To reach 70%% MEMORY SOL REQUIRES the full fp8-fold + fp8-WGMMA (grouped-by-expert) kernel = EP dev_m technique = large build. Best kept = iter10 smem-LUT.

## Log

### baseline — vectorized torch
- What: per-rank sharded FFN via mxfp4-dequant + einsum grouped matmul + SwiGLU + `dist.all_reduce`. MXFP4 dequant + compute in torch (to be CUDA-ized).
- Result: RUNTIME=48.93 ms, cosine=0.99999, REF=20.25 ms, SPEEDUP=0.41x. finite=True.
- Read: torch einsum gathers per-pair weights `gate_w[fe]` -> [M*topk, Is, H] materialization; re-dequants l1+l2 every call. Both are the obvious first targets. Real perf will come from a CUDA fused MXFP4 kernel; intermediate iters can cut torch waste first.

## 2026-09-02 V4-Flash TP baseline reset

The optimization target was reset to the real pure-TP serving path: H=4096,
I=2048, E=256, top-k=6, TP4 primary (TP8 runnable), with precomputed real
`topk_ids`/`topk_weights`, no EP dispatch/combine, and one SGLang
`CustomAllReduceV2` after the local expert reduction.  Formal timing is the
maximum rank latency of a full CUDA-Graph replay.

### Baseline harness smoke — Humming OCP MXFP4 + CustomAllReduceV2

- What: added `bench/v4_flash_tp_humming_graph.py`; graph contains SGLang route
  alignment, BF16-to-FP8 group-128 quant, indexed Humming MXFP4 W13, SwiGLU,
  second quant, indexed W2, local k6 weighted sum, and custom all-reduce v2.
- Shape: TP4 W13 `[256,1024,4096]`, W2 `[256,4096,512]`; H20 reports 78 SM.
  Humming transformed bytes/rank are 570,425,344 (W13) and 285,212,672 (W2).
- First diagnostic run: M8 0.1830 ms, but generic random E8M0 bit patterns made
  FP32 norms overflow (`cos=0`, `rel_l2=NaN`); rejected as a correctness result.
- Fix: keep packed FP4 codes random, initialize E8M0 scales to 1, and compute
  untimed diagnostics in FP64.  This changes data values only, not the kernel
  path or timed graph.
- Valid smoke (M8, balanced routes, only 2 replays): 0.156736 ms; custom-AR graph
  output vs NCCL sum has min-rank cosine 0.9999957033, max-rank rel-L2
  0.0029315142, and finite output on all ranks.  Marked smoke only; formal
  5-point/7-outer-run baseline still pending.

### Baseline formal attempt 1 — rejected pull-path reference

- TP4 balanced-route max-rank medians (7 outer samples x 100 graph replays):
  M8 0.092633, M16 0.156537, M32 0.294000, M64 0.389452,
  M128 0.418304 ms.
- Push-path checks (M8/16/32) passed with cosine >=0.9999955 and rel-L2
  <=0.00299.  Pull-path M64/128 showed cosine 1.0 and rel-L2 exactly 0.75.
- Root cause: `TWO_SHOT_PULL` may overwrite/reuse the custom-AR input.  The
  harness cloned that already-reduced buffer and then reduced it once more via
  NCCL, making the reference exactly 4x the graph result.  This is a reference
  bug, not evidence of a kernel error.
- Decision: do not accept this attempt as the formal baseline.  Correctness now
  recomputes the local pipeline into independent untimed buffers before NCCL;
  rerun all five points.

### Accepted TP4 Humming baseline — balanced routes, full CUDA Graph

- Protocol: 9 outer samples, 200 graph replays/sample, 50 warm-up replays;
  reported latency is the maximum rank average for every outer sample.
- Max-rank latency min / median / max (ms):
  - M8: 0.092545 / 0.092644 / 0.093283
  - M16: 0.156270 / 0.156437 / 0.156623
  - M32: 0.289523 / 0.294363 / 0.351842
  - M64: 0.397270 / 0.412274 / 0.435562
  - M128: 0.411079 / 0.430198 / 0.459386
- Geometric mean of the five medians: 0.237563 ms.
- Correctness: every point finite; min-rank cosine >=0.9999886295 and
  max-rank rel-L2 <=0.0047687842 against NCCL sum of an independently
  recomputed local output.  Both one-shot-push (M<=32) and graph
  two-shot-pull (M>=64) paths pass.
- Noise note: M32's last three samples and the larger-M samples show transient
  slowdown.  Keep min/median/max and require repeatability when judging an
  optimization; do not compare a candidate's minimum with this median.
- Evidence log:
  `bench/results/tp4_humming_graph_balanced_formal_v2_20260902.log`.

### Accepted TP4 Humming route-skew control

- Route: every token selects the same six distinct experts (legal maximal
  skew); router remains precomputed and untimed.
- Max-rank latency min / median / max (ms), same 9x200 protocol:
  - M8: 0.031925 / 0.031967 / 0.032896
  - M16: 0.039892 / 0.039931 / 0.039978
  - M32: 0.059635 / 0.059686 / 0.060581
  - M64: 0.094630 / 0.094663 / 0.094918
  - M128: 0.163625 / 0.164054 / 0.164349
- All five NCCL checks pass; min cosine 0.9999352, max rel-L2 0.0113814.
- Finding: route distribution is first-order.  At M32, changing only active
  experts from 192 to 6 reduces the same graph from 0.294363 to 0.059686 ms
  (4.93x).  Raw `G` cannot stand in for a real routed-MoE benchmark.
- Policy: balanced routes remain the primary optimization score, while this
  skew case is a mandatory counterexample check.
- Evidence log: `bench/results/tp4_humming_graph_skew_formal_20260902.log`.

### Route-aware RS-WGMMA bring-up — correctness first

- Starting point: preserved the braided MXFP4-to-FP8 register dequant and
  swap-AB `m64n8k32` RS-WGMMA core from `step_e_lutg.py`/`step_e_fc2.py`.
- Changed: raw `G` and shared `X[8,K]` were replaced by SGLang
  `sorted_ids`/`expert_ids`/`num_tokens_padded`; each tile gathers its real
  token rows, applies per-token FP8 group-128 scales per K tile, writes W13
  split-K partials, reduces into BF16 SwiGLU, and fuses W2 route weighting into
  FP32 local-token scatter.  Shapes specialize both TP4 Is=512 and TP8 Is=256.
- TP4 M8 balanced (48 active experts, all 48 routes, padded to 384 rows):
  W13 cosine 0.999999998 / rel-L2 0.000076187; activation cosine
  0.999999759; W2+local-reduce cosine 0.999999993 / rel-L2 0.000126339.
- TP4 M8 maximal skew (6 active experts, 8 real tokens/expert): W13 cosine
  0.999999997, activation 0.999999649, W2 0.999999992.
- TP8-template M8 balanced (Is=256): W13 cosine 0.999999997, activation
  0.999999745, W2 0.999999710 / rel-L2 0.000762151.
- All checks cover every output block and every split-K partial against a
  torch dequant/matmul reference; all outputs finite.  No performance claim
  yet.

### Route-aware WGMMA full-graph smoke (split-K=4)

- Added the end-to-end graph path with the same timed route alignment,
  BF16-to-FP8 group-128 quantization, and SGLang `CustomAllReduceV2` as the
  Humming baseline.  W13 split partial reduction + SwiGLU and W2 weighted local
  scatter are custom kernels inherited from the reviewed WGMMA implementation.
- TP4 M8 balanced, cold smoke protocol (1 outer sample x only 2 replays):
  0.225584 ms, custom-AR vs independent local+NCCL cosine 0.9999956064,
  rel-L2 0.0029644006, finite.
- The accepted Humming M8 median is 0.092644 ms, so this preliminary point is
  2.44x slower.  Do not treat that ratio as final: Humming's analogous 2-replay
  smoke was 0.156736 ms (1.69x above its long-replay result).  Next run uses the
  exact baseline 9x200 protocol for all five M values.

### Route-aware WGMMA iteration 1 — formal TP4 graph baseline

- Protocol matches Humming exactly: balanced precomputed routes, 9 outer
  samples x 200 graph replays, max rank, route align + both group-128 FP8
  quantizations + local pipeline + default CustomAllReduceV2 all timed.
- Max-rank latency min / median / max (ms):
  - M8: 0.136533 / 0.136652 / 0.137908
  - M16: 0.237250 / 0.237389 / 0.237955
  - M32: 0.444652 / 0.464574 / 0.473932
  - M64: 0.599627 / 0.611745 / 0.625516
  - M128: 0.616757 / 0.629871 / 0.641963
- Humming median comparison (custom / Humming): M8 1.475x, M16 1.517x,
  M32 1.578x, M64 1.484x, M128 1.464x.  Five-point median geometric mean is
  0.357101 vs 0.237563 ms = 1.503x slower.  The target is not met.
- Correctness: all custom-AR checks pass; min cosine 0.99999555, max rel-L2
  0.00298319, all finite.
- Read: the real route-aware integration invalidates any claim based on the old
  raw-G bandwidth alone.  Profile stage costs before changing the kernel;
  likely candidates are W13 split-K partial traffic, W2 throughput, and excess
  fixed-grid CTAs from graph-safe route alignment.

  `bench/results/tp4_wgmma_graph_balanced_s4_formal_v1_20260902.log`.

### Benchmark protocol correction — explicit cold L2 is mandatory

- User directive (2026-09-02): every subsequent performance benchmark must
  use cold L2.  The earlier continuous-replay results above are retained only
  as warm/steady-state diagnostics and must not be used as the optimization
  score or final comparison.
- Measured H20 L2 size is 62,914,560 bytes (60 MiB).  Both the Humming and
  custom graph harnesses now allocate Triton's standard 256 MiB benchmark
  cache buffer and clear it on the benchmark stream before every individually
  timed graph replay.  The start event is recorded after the clear and the end
  event after the replay, so cache eviction is ordered but excluded from the
  reported latency.
- TP4 M8 balanced smoke, 1 outer x 10 cold replays:
  - Humming min / median / max: 0.095904 / 0.096752 / 0.248672 ms.
  - Custom split-K=4 min / median / max: 0.141408 / 0.142560 / 0.296864 ms.
  - Median custom / Humming: 1.473x (custom is 47.3% slower).
- Both graph outputs pass CustomAllReduceV2 versus an independent local
  recompute plus NCCL sum: minimum cosine is 0.999995606 and all values are
  finite.  Ten samples only validate the cold-L2 mechanism; they are not the
  formal performance result.
- Evidence logs:
  `bench/results/tp4_humming_graph_coldl2_smoke_m8.log` and
  `bench/results/tp4_wgmma_graph_coldl2_smoke_m8_s4.log`.

### Accepted TP4 cold-L2 baseline — Humming versus route-aware WGMMA

- Protocol: balanced precomputed routes, full CUDA Graph, 9 outer batches x
  200 individually timed replays per M, and a 256 MiB same-stream clear before
  every replay.  Latency is the maximum rank event time; medians below pool all
  1,800 cold samples per point.
- Humming min / median / max (ms):
  - M8: 0.095040 / 0.096864 / 0.296320
  - M16: 0.158400 / 0.160064 / 1.614496
  - M32: 0.290560 / 0.293984 / 0.349056
  - M64: 0.386656 / 0.406176 / 0.458016
  - M128: 0.392128 / 0.412752 / 0.493440
- Custom split-K=4 min / median / max (ms):
  - M8: 0.140352 / 0.142080 / 0.286400
  - M16: 0.241152 / 0.243136 / 0.289536
  - M32: 0.448192 / 0.450896 / 0.839104
  - M64: 0.596192 / 0.607264 / 0.635904
  - M128: 0.612864 / 0.627456 / 0.685664
- Median custom / Humming ratios: 1.467x, 1.519x, 1.534x, 1.495x,
  and 1.520x for M8 through M128.  Five-point geometric means are 0.358661
  versus 0.238033 ms, so custom is 1.507x slower.  The target is not met.
- Correctness: all ten graph outputs are finite and pass custom all-reduce
  against independent local recompute plus NCCL.  Minimum cosine is
  0.999987363 for Humming and 0.999995477 for custom; maximum rel-L2 is
  0.00502738 and 0.00300767 respectively.
- Rare global maxima show scheduler/system tails (notably Humming M16), while
  the nine per-batch medians are stable.  Optimization decisions use pooled
  medians plus the batch-median distribution, never minima.

  `bench/results/tp4_humming_graph_coldl2_formal_20260902.log` and
  `bench/results/tp4_wgmma_graph_coldl2_s4_formal_20260902.log`.

### TP4 cold-L2 W13 split-K screen

- Screen protocol: balanced full graph, 3 outer batches x 100 individually
  cold replays per M, with the same 256 MiB clear and max-rank timing as the
  accepted baseline.  Correctness passes for every configuration and point.
- Median latency (ms), M8 / M16 / M32 / M64 / M128:
  - split-K=1: 0.143616 / 0.250672 / 0.454784 / 0.595040 / 0.610048;
    geometric mean 0.358761 ms.
  - split-K=2: 0.144224 / 0.245664 / 0.447424 / 0.588320 / 0.603328;
    geometric mean 0.354857 ms.
  - split-K=4 accepted formal reference: 0.142080 / 0.243136 / 0.450896 /
    0.607264 / 0.627456; geometric mean 0.358661 ms.
  - split-K=8: 0.146368 / 0.252864 / 0.467472 / 0.618048 / 0.638432;
    geometric mean 0.368846 ms.
- Finding: split-K=4 remains best at M8/M16, while split-K=2 wins at
  M32/M64/M128 by about 0.8%/3.1%/3.8% versus the split-K=4 formal medians.
  Split-K=8 is a regression everywhere.  A global split-K=2 default improves
  the five-point geometric mean only 1.1%, so split selection cannot close the
  roughly 50% Humming gap; profile stage costs before altering the core.
